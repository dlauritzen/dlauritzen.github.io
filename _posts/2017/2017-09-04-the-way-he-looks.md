Welcome to my first movie review. I plan on writing reviews of my favorite LGBT movies here for my friends and family who wouldn't normally think to watch them, or who might be afraid to seek out movies like this for fear of encountering, shall we say, *interesting* content.

I have a few movies lined up to be reviewed, but if there's any movie you may have heard of but want my opinion on, let me know and I'll look into it.

> **Standard disclaimer**: The things I notice or find acceptable in movies may differ from your own standards. While I try to list any content that may be considered inappropriate, you are ultimately responsible for what you watch.

## Summary

Leonardo is blind. His best (slash only) friend, Giovanna, probably has a little crush on him, and his parents are pretty protective. When new boy Gabriel arrives in his class and the two are partnered up on an assignment, Giovanna becomes jealous. But Leo is working through his own growing feelings for Gabriel while dealing with school bullies and wanting to get away from home and be independent.

## Why I Like It

I really like this movie because it follows a budding relationship that's not based on looks. The crush Leo has on Gabriel feels exactly right: you want to be close to him, you don't know if he likes you back, but you can't help it. You're willing to do new things you'd never think to enjoy just because he'll be there. And when it looks like he likes someone else, it crushes you.

Giovanna is a great best friend, but she's no saint. She's jealous of Leo suddenly wanting to spend time with Gabriel instead of her. But when it matters, she defends and helps him out. And when he tells her how he feels about Gabriel, she doesn't have the best reaction. But she quickly gets over it and all is mended.

Gabriel is a bit of a mystery, but we get pieces of him as the story progresses. As an audience, we want to know whether he likes the girl who keeps flirting with him, the protagonist, or the best friend. And when he kisses Leo at a party then claims not to remember it, we feel our stomachs drop.

Most of my favorite moments in the movie happen in the actors' faces. Because Leo can't see his friends, but the audience can, we understand when something he says hurts them, or when they're hiding something.

## Why I Recommend It

This movie shows a realistic gay romance without relying on crude humor or sex. But it doesn't shy away from showing that sexual feelings are often a part of attraction. It honors the truth and difficulties of growing up and finding love.

## Content Guide

One scene involves Gabriel and Leonardo showering after swimming. Rear nudity of both boys. Leo doesn't want to shower in front of the other boys because it's embarrassing, so after they're all gone, the two are alone in the locker room. At first Leo keeps his swimsuit on, but eventually removes since it's inconvenient. When Gabriel sees Leo naked, he gets an erection and tries to hide it by ending his shower early. This shows the audience that he is, indeed, attracted to Leo, but not yet ready to confess.
