I've met with a therapist a few times now, and it is going very well. We've been able to dig a little into my heart and expose some of the things I believe about myself. And after each session, I find the most important lesson learned just feels too important, powerful, and raw to share with anyone else. And so forgive me that I'm not going to write a mind-blowing dissertation on the inner workings of my mind. Because even though I probably will start sharing some of these things with some people soon, I don't think sharing them online will have the proper effect, either on me or on you.
