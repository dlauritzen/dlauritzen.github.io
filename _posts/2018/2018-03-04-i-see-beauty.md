The curve of a jaw.  
The bright eyes  
under perfectly  
messy hair.

The miraculous machinery  
of shoulders, back, and chest  
that move and breathe and  
explore the world.

All these things  
I have, myself.  
But on another,  
they're a mystery.

May I reach out  
and touch?  
Not to control, abuse,  
or make my own.

But because,  
on me I see flaws.  
Yet,  
on you I see beauty.
