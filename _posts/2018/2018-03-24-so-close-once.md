Time passes. Morning comes. And last night is no more.

Now we've had some time apart. Only a few hours, but long enough for feelings to become memory. Long enough for reality to set in once again.

What will happen when we meet again? Will we fall into each other's arms without a care, or will the barriers we've erected rematerialize? Will we be ashamed of the things we shared?

In the real world friendships form in little pieces, built up over time until two souls are inseparable by time and space. But in our world, we're so starved that we jump in all at once. So now that we've surfaced, what is left intact? When we inspect the fragments, will we find a growing seed or an embarrassing mess?

Don't let this revolving door of closeness and loneliness keep turning. I'm too scared to ask for what I need, what I've never really had. Don't close yourself to me. I don't know how to do this.

What are we now? Are we friends, or just leaves passing in the wind?
