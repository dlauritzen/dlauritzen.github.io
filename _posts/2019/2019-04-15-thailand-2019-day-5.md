We didn't do much today.

Yesterday when we were shopping I looked at the Songkran schedule and we planned to go to some events this evening, which gave us the morning off. 

I woke up at 8 am, but only after Stori had already gotten up and walked into the living room area. She raised the curtains and sat down with her phone. I didn't know what time it was but my phone was on the other side of some blinds so I peeked through them. Once I knew it was a reasonable hour to get up I joined her. We went to breakfast to give housekeeping time to clean up.

When we came back they were just finishing; the door was still open. The last thing they did was walk in with a new plate of fruit, including some rambutan, which I had never had before. Stori looked up what they were and how to eat them. For the rest of the morning we eat did our own thing. I wrote up the blog post covering yesterday's adventures. Stori edited some of her GoPro footage into a video or two.

For lunch we went to a farm-to-table restaurant Stori had found, Ohkajhu Organic. It was very close, so we thought we'd come back after lunch for a few more hours before heading out again. Walking over there we saw a lot more pedestrians than earlier in the week, which made us a lot more confident. When we arrived the waiting area was pretty full, but they seated everyone very fast. We think everyone must have arrived at the same time.  When they called our name they gave us a piece of paper and told us where to go. We kept showing the paper to people until we got to our seats.

I ordered a fruit and vegetable salad, a milk tea, and a pineapple strawberry smoothie (I figured the smoothie would be dessert).  Stori built her own salad, some garlic bread, and water. When the food arrived it was surprisingly large. We think each one was big enough to feed two people, and neither of us finished our meal. I called over one of the waiters and attempted to ask him in Thai to box my food up. Once he understood what I was trying to say he picked up the plate and headed off. I had been saying the words wrong (full on wrong vowel, not a misplaced tone). Pretty quickly we asked a different waitress to box up Stori's food and get us the check. I did that one in English.

Right as lunch was finishing up I started feeling tired and didn't know if I wanted to head out this evening any more. We had a few hours before we were supposed to leave anyway, so we'd see how I felt then. 

By the time 5 pm came around I decided I was okay not seeing the last two Songkran things we were thinking about tonight. Stori was totally fine with this since she didn't want to deal with getting wet again, and I figured the cultural center dinner we booked for Wednesday evening would be very similar to whatever the Folklife Museum had scheduled anyway. Plus, we have to be up and ready pretty early tomorrow morning to get picked up and taken to the elephant sanctuary where we'll spend the morning. 

We hopped over to the mall to get me a swimsuit for getting wet and muddy tomorrow, and I also grabbed a BL graphic novel that's being made into a yet-to-air tv show. I couldn't find any of the novels for shows I already like, but if I like this one I could order them later. I wanted to get something in person while I had the chance.

For dinner we went to Oishi Ramen, then to Swenson's for dessert, where I got some bingsu. After tasting it I came up with a fun way to describe what it's like. It's what snow cones dream heaven is like.
