It's that time of the year again.

2014 will be a year I always remember and respect: I made no major purchases or career changes; I spent almost all of my free time either being lazy or contemplating a single topic; but today I see myself and the world very differently.

I feel like a lot of the things I want to say have already been said in previous posts... But I plow on.

This is the year I came out. I finally opened the gates and allowed myself to experience the world. I learned to be authentic with others. I learned to like myself. I experienced many firsts.

This is the year I made friends. I reconnected with old friends, and at work, church, and through North Star I found an amazing variety of dear new friends who love me. I continue to be amazed and grateful.

This is the year I began to take charge. In past years I've often felt as if I'm just trying to keep my head above water, reacting to problems and threats like a drowning man desperate for air. This year I finally feel like I've gained a strong foundation. I feel like I can take on the challenges ahead without losing myself.

### 2015

Speaking of the challenges ahead, the other half of New Year's is to look forward at the coming year and make resolutions. I'm happy to say I have none!

No "resolutions," at least. Instead I have chosen a single word to act as mantra and motivation, a guiding principle throughout the year in all decisions and aspects of life: **Decide**.

In 2015 I want to continue along my current path, climbing out of the swamp I've languished in for so long. I want to feel like I am making my own decisions. I want to be the [captain of my soul][1].

When I look back at this year, I won't remember every particular event, but I will remember how much I changed. Bring on the new year!
