... I'm usually good at introductions... Oh well.

My entertainment habits have changed a bit in the last two years as I've become comfortable with myself and my interests. Even before I knew I was gay you would probably get suspicious if you looked at the people I followed on Twitter or YouTube. Once the closet was behind me, I started actively admitting that I subscribed to people who I found attractive, or who might belong to the LGBTQ+ world. Since 2015 was "the year of coming out" it became very easy to find people who I could watch and get to know their experiences.

All the coming out videos I saw had one thing in common. They all said something like "I'm making this video for people still in the closet, because videos like this helped me. I want you to know that we are here. You have friends. We support and love you. And even if you aren't ready to come out yet, that's okay."

When you watch videos by people who are well past coming out, sometimes you'll hear them groan that "coming out" is even a thing. They say that you shouldn't ever have to "come out," you should just be able to be yourself from the start without everyone assuming you're heteronormative (a.k.a. "straight"). But then they concede that the world isn't quite there, yet.

So, on to the reason I started writing this post.

There's a certain YouTuber I'm subscribed to, who shall remain nameless. My reason for subscribing, I admit, is that I find him attractive. He has made it clear on many occasions that he is attracted to women. But he has also participated in multiple same-gender kisses. In one video he implied that he _might_ be questioning, but asked everyone to stop making a big deal about it.

And here's why I wrote this. I kind of hope he never makes a "coming out" video. I hope he continues to be straight, bisexual, gay, or whatever, and never makes it "official." Because then he would be that person that didn't have to come out, but was able to be themselves out in the open. He would be someone that didn't hide their sexuality, but didn't make a big deal about it either. Because if he can do that, then maybe we are getting closer to that world where it isn't a big deal anymore.
