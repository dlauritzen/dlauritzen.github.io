Lately I've been listening to [The Gay Revolution][1] by Lillian Faderman. I grew up unaware of the LGBTQ+ movement, so once I consciously joined the community I wanted to learn about the people involved in its history. It's a really long book, so I'm not going to summarize it here. There are a few interesting or sad things I wanted to mention, though.

The biggest thing these people had to fight against was the public opinion against them. Over and over for decades they are being called perverts, sick, child molesters. Religious people use the bible to justify hatred and death threats. Judges and politicians make horrible public statements with impunity. They are dishonorably discharged from military service and fired from their jobs. Every excuse or fear against them is exaggerated into the extreme.

But slowly, they made progress. They convinced the American Psychiatric Association (APA) that there was no scientific evidence supporting their classification of homosexuality as a pathological disorder. They began to organize together, showing the nation that there are millions of them and closeted people that they are not alone.

Before I came to terms with my attractions I, too, was prejudiced against LGBT people. I knew only what I had been taught growing up and through the media. I never considered that there was as much variety and reality in that community as in any other. But once I gave them a chance I saw.

I met high school students, lawyers, teachers, athletes. I met people from all over the world. I met people who were single, divorced, and happily married. I made friends with transgender people, and guys with boyfriends. I met parents who were trying to support their children. I met parents who had lost their children to suicide.

To Christians who use the Bible to justify hatred, I call upon you to remember the true message of Christ. Jesus Christ came to Earth, suffered, and died so that we can all be forgiven of our own sins. All judgment is His alone. Our commandment is to love one another, as He has loved us. We are not called upon to judge others, or condemn them. We are called upon to teach the Gospel and love all people.

To parents who feel they cannot support their children, I ask, do you love them? Did you love them when they were born? Did you love them before you knew about their gender identity or sexual orientation? Then love them now. They need your love more than anything.

To people still trying to understand or accept their own feelings, you are loved. You are not alone. Whether you are "closeted" or not, I beg you to talk to someone. Don't keep your emotions bottled up. Find a friend, family member, or counselor you can be honest with. If you don't know anyone you think you can trust, [talk to me][2].

Every person in the world is unique. Don't judge someone based on a stereotype, and don't think that you're better than someone because they do something you don't. Everyone has their own struggles. It's this diversity that makes life beautiful.
