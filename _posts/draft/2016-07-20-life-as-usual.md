Right now I'm either feeling bored or depressed.

Yesterday I was in Salt Lake City for something I'll talk about eventually. Afterwards I took the chance to visit the temple and participate in some of the work inside. There was plenty of waiting time where I was able to sit and think about things without any gadgets or distractions. And when I was done and sitting around before leaving, I thought about how I was feeling right then.

In the temple, or other spiritual settings, I'm easily able to feel a calm peace. Where usually I'm either feeling empty, sad, or too distracted to notice what I'm feeling, there I am content. It's so elusive I often forget what it feels like. And when I'm tempted to pursue other, darker paths to satisfaction, it doesn't occur to me that what I'm really after is this peace.

So even now as I sit here, feeling a desperate hunger for something, *anything*, it's as if something sinister is sitting between me and happiness, blocking the light. My mind remembers the idea of joy, and the possibility of how to reach for it. But that insidious darkness laughs at me and I do nothing.

There's an important difference between motivation and discipline. New Year's resolutions are motivation. And the motivation is strong enough to get people to go to the gym or follow a diet. For a time. But the motivation gets overshadowed by other things like pain, hunger, or busy schedules. And once the motivation is gone, the person stops. They may blame themselves, feeling bad that they don't feel like continuing. But that's not the point. People who only act when motivated are taking an easy path. If we only did things we were excited about, most people would never go to work or wash their laundry. Discipline is much more powerful, but it takes effort to cultivate.
