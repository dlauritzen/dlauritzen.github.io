I'm starting to believe more and more that the "empty" feeling that haunts my private life has a name. And I don't think it's depression. I think it's loneliness.

Here's my current theory on the history of my sadness:

At some young age (i.e. before high school) I become aware of a special appreciation of boys. This is not normal, I know, and I manage to lock it away so that even I forget the reason why. But this sense of being "different" remains, and manifests in some particular ways. I decide that most boys my age have wildly different interests and humors than I do. I don't understand why they think certain things are funny or what's so important about whatever they value. I feel more comfortable around adults, because they are less scary, more predictable or consistent. Whenever I'm walking through a crowd and hear or see people laughing, I automatically feel like they're laughing at me. But overall things are fine, because I have my group of friends and however I managed to entertain myself back then.

Enter high school drama. During this period of uncomfortable stress I discover the wonders of the internet from the secret confines of my bedroom. This clandestine practice is powerful for many reasons. It's potent stress relief. There's a sense of danger and thrill from doing something I'm not supposed to. And it's the first time I begin to experience and experiment with sexual feelings. But I'm unable to escape the religious disapproval of my behavior, which joins onto the supposed religious and cultural disapproval of my apparent sexuality to burrow into my subconscious sense of self worth. My spontaneous creativity evaporates. I become more analytical and detached. But I'm able to distract myself when with friends, which helps me make it through to graduation more or less in one piece.

In my freshman year of college I'm in an apartment with five other guys, which provide much needed and much appreciated social interaction, but I avoid making deep connections with any of them. Probably out of fear of being rejected. The year goes very well, and I leave on my mission, but return early for medical tests and recovery.

I spend the next few months mostly alone, and when I return to college I get a private room with roommates whom I don't see very often. I quickly return to my old bad habits, but I think this time it wasn't to relieve stress; school wasn't difficult. I think this time it was to relieve loneliness. My high school friends weren't around. My roommates weren't inviting me to anything. And my fear of being vulnerable and honest kept me from connecting with anyone. Going online let me forget all that. This continues throughout the next three years.

My last year of college was a little better. My roommates were more active and interested in having me around. They even managed to get me to go on a few dates; the only dates I went on in college. I had settled into a lone wolf pattern, but I was also starting to work on discovering why I felt the way I did, and they're genuine interest in me pulled me out a little. By the end of that year I felt comfortable around them.

After graduation I moved into a private apartment.
