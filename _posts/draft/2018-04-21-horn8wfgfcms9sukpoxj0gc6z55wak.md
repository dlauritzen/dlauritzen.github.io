Recently I've been noticing this trend among Christians to talk about same-sex attraction and gender dysphoria as if they are great trials and deserve our sympathy and prayers. I even see it from LGBTQ+ Christians when talking about themselves. While this is so much better than treating anything of the sort like a plague of the damned, it's still missing the mark. It categorizes a natural and somewhat fundamental part of a person's identity as something unfortunate. It's like someone saying "I understand how hard it is for you to be left-handed."

Now there are certainly difficult things about experiencing some aspect of the LGBTQ+ rainbow, but I can't think of a single one that's not caused by social structures and expectations.
