I didn't know this until after I was already out, but October 11th is national coming-out day. This day is not meant to pressure anyone into coming out, but rather it is a day to honor and support everyone in the LGBTQ+ community. I thought I'd use the opportunity to write up my thoughts on life after coming out.

## But First, the Closet

I don't claim to have a normal story. I wasn't technically "closeted" growing up because I didn't realize that my attractions were anything different. I knew that boys looked good, but I didn't want to be romantic with them. I didn't want to be romantic with *anyone*. It wasn't until one evening on the phone with my mom after graduating college that I made the connection between my attraction to guys and anything related to the word "gay."

Once I knew the truth, I had a very accelerated course in learning to cope and accept this new understanding of my love life, or lack thereof. I told some close friends, and talked regularly with my parents. I asked and answered questions about how life would proceed. See [my actual coming out post](/post/no-more-secrets/) for a little more detail on what was going through my head at the time.

Then I surprised myself by deciding to come out publicly, not even a year after realizing the truth myself. I told the rest of my siblings and drafted up my blog post. Then on May 1, 2014, I posted it on my blog and Facebook and left the house with my phone off.

## The First Few Months

It was all I could think about. This was such a new thing to me, I had a lot of questions for myself.
