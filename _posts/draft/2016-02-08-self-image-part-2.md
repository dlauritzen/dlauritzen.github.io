So, after getting started on my last post and realizing it was going to be too long to work with, I decided to split it up into multiple posts. This also allowed me to actually plan out the topics in advance.

Today I'll be talking about relationships with other people. This includes making friends, interacting with strangers, and the scary concept of actually getting romantic with someone.

## Other People

Yeah, this is a series of posts about self-image, but how you feel about yourself is related to how you feel about other people and how they feel about you (or what you *think* they feel about you).

### Strangers

They're everywhere, and you have to talk to them a lot. But, every friend was once a stranger, which means every stranger has the potential of becoming a friend.

I'm not uncomfortable around strangers that have some understandable role to play, like store employees, police, or co-workers. But when  And I actually have a history of jumping into random conversations.
