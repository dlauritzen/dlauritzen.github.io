I'm just going to ramble for a bit, okay? I haven't posted in a while. I apparently have some things bottled up.





> "In the Church, being gay isn't like being a smoker, or an alcoholic, or having a short temper. It's just like being straight --and 15.  
>   
> You can't date. You can't marry. You can't pursue those you're attracted to. You just have to wait. But you'll never turn 16 in this life."




That quote (from [this article](https://byuusga.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/everything-wrong-with-that-meridian-magazine-article/)), from an anonymous member of BYU's USGA, explains the conflict of same sex attraction in the context of the LDS Church simply and in a new and interesting way. I had started to write up a Facebook post sharing the article and talking about the quote, but then it started getting long. So here I am :)

I like the analogy. The author's point is that sexual orientation is not like an addiction or vice. It's not something that only hurts. Feeling attraction towards the same gender is exactly the same as feeling attraction towards the opposite gender, really. The feelings are just as valid and deep. We aren't pedophiles or sex-crazed maniacs. We're just as varied and unique as strait folk. So stop relating it to anything but what it is.

Recently I've been investigating myself a little deeper. My last post implicitly questioned whether I was asexual. I've talked to some people since then and I reserve judgment for now. Just a day or two ago someone posted a [Kinsey scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale) quiz that I took. Your place on the scale is self-chosen, but I thought it'd be interesting to see where it put me. It said my answers reflected someone who is non-sexual -- either that or it couldn't place me at all -- but as I said, I might just be overanalyzing myself. I place myself at a 5 on the scale, meaning my attractions are "predominantly homosexual, and only incidentally heterosexual." *Technically* that means I could call myself bisexual and be done with it, so why bother? Why call myself gay in the same sentence that I admit the ability to be attracted to women?

Some people would say that I can't be gay if I ever *ever* like a girl. But labels are what you make of them. If I liked boys and girls relatively equally, I'd call myself bi, but since I like guys *a whole lot* *more* than girls, I say gay.

There's a generational gap when it comes to the word "gay." Many of the (I say this nicely) older generation has an indivisible association between the word and the stereotype. I've encountered this myself with family members trying to encourage me to avoid applying the word to myself (see [this](http://dallinlauritzen.com/post/the-power-of-identity) blog post for a deeper discussion on how I feel about labels in general). I know that people will form an impression of me from the labels I use, but I don't mind. I have separated the word from the stereotype in my mind because I have known so many different people who qualify as gay by my definition, both in and out of the Church. I say it without any malice or assumption.

So now I can talk specifically about the quote at the top as it relates to me. As someone who admits at least the remote possibility of finding a wife in this mortal life, I'm a bit more hopeful than the quote's author. But as someone who has yet to experience such a relationship, I agree with the sentiment. It's painful to be aware of your attractions but still have a determination to not act on them.

That's one of the most common things people mention when I have a discussion with them on the subject. I tell them that my situation is just like theirs, just switch the genders. "Yeah, but we can get married," they remind me. Yeah, I know. That's the annoying part. There's no gospel-sanctioned outlet for our strongest feelings.
