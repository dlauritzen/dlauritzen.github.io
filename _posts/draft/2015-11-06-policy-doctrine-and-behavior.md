Yesterday a large corner of the Internet exploded when several news sites reported some updates to one of the leadership manuals of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints concerning married same-sex couples and their children. The updates added marriage to a person of the same sex under the umbrella of apostasy and cause for church disciplinary action. Also, children of a same-sex married couple cannot be baptized until the age of eighteen and require First Presidency approval.

After learning the news, I couldn't process it. I thought, "Don't believe it until you see something official. News can be wrong." But it's been spreading rapidly with no one disproving it so far that I've seen. People that I've never heard discuss this topic are sharing thoughts and concerns now. If this is wrong, it needs to be snuffed out ASAP, but until disproven by a credible source, I will act as if it is true.

This hits home the hardest of all the things I've experienced. I wasn't involved in the LGBTQ+ world when the craziness of Prop 8 was happening, so I didn't associate it with me or any of my friends or family. In the two years that I have been involved, nothing that has happened has been painful for me to accept. I supported the legality of same-sex marriage, so that wasn't a shock when it passed. In all the discussions about same-sex marriage, or Caitlyn Jenner, or whatever, I always advocated a position of openness and love on all sides. It felt like the world was (very) slowly shifting in the right direction.

So to read something that feels like it is contradictory to everything that has been said recently by the leaders of the church really hurts. It's deep and I don't know how to navigate down here. I feel a bit like watching a horrible train wreck: it hurts to watch but I can't look away. I keep reading posts by friends, even though they almost always lead to more confusion and sorrow on my part. I also think that I shouldn't read them because they might affect the way I feel about things, and I haven't really settled on exactly how I feel.

See, I can argue both sides.

In support of the Church, this is an understandable clarification of policy. Same sex marriage is contrary to the doctrine of eternal life. There can be no support of such an institution in a religion that believes in the sanctity of eternal marriage and family. Hard lines must be drawn, but they do this out of love. Church disciplinary action is not a matter of hate. Membership in the Church (formalized by baptism and the covenant it entails) comes with responsibilities. The baptism covenant is to obey the commandments of God and stand as a witness of Christ. By entering into this covenant, members become responsible to God to keep it. When someone breaks covenants, such as in cases of adultery or other criminal acts, church disciplinary action may be taken. The purpose of discipline is to open the way for the Atonement of Christ to take effect in cases of serious sin.
