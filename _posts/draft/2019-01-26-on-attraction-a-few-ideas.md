I started this blog with my official coming-out post, and ever since then it's been my platform to share what's going through my head. A place where I can vent or geek out. A place where I can be serious, creative, or silly. I can see a pretty clear progression from where I was those years ago to now. And while it might not be the path people think I should take, I'm glad I've had the opportunity to experience it.

What I want to write today isn't very clear inside my own head. It's a work in progress, and it's the kind of work that will probably take a few thousand years or so to polish. But it's interesting to me, and it might be interesting to you as well. But I will warn you: I'll be talking about sexual attraction and nudity/porn.

I didn't understand what I was feeling around boys when I was young. It was both perfectly normal (because I had always felt it) and extremely odd (because I never saw other people doing it). When I was particularly young and yet to learn some discretion, I did things that make me cringe looking back today, like grabbing someone's shirt, pulling him close, and pretending to eat him just to get a chance to look down his shirt. I didn't call it attraction, because I didn't have the words or example.

As I got a little older I figured out how to admire from afar. I'd take any opportunity I could to see some skin, but I didn't forcefully cause such situations myself. I knew that I liked the way these boys looked, but when pressed I decided that it was mere admiration of the "machinery." I knew what "gay" was, but never seriously considered that it might apply to me, because the only examples I had of the subject were exaggerated media portrayals or religious taboos.

The first memory I have of online nudity is doing an image search at my dad's computer lab while he was in another room. I think I was curious about what other boy's looked like down there so I stole the opportunity while I was alone and on an unfiltered (maybe) network. I don't remember any details besides that, and my concept of how old I was cannot be trusted.

So later, in high school when stress hit me I somehow got the idea of circumventing the house content filter by using the server my brother let me practice website programming on to navigate and download pictures. This became my original source of what I thought of for a long time as a porn addiction.

When I finally figured out the right labels for this attraction, I was already in my twenties and shy. But I was able to start thinking through my past, present, and future. I could categorize and understand what was happening to me as I grew up. And most importantly I could process the feelings I encountered in real time.

But I had a lot of catching up to do. I wasn't a teenager any more, but I found it easier to find attractive guys who were younger than me. This has worried me a lot, enough so that until now I have only told a few people the full details. Please hear me out.

I explained my "type" back in my [Masculinity](/post/masculinity) post. I said that too buff is a turn-off, that there needs to be some amount of softness, but that too soft is less exciting. The part that scares me is that it is possible for me to find attraction in fairly young boys. It's scary because I know how much damage pedophiles can do, and how so many people associate gay men with child molesters. I didn't want to be branded as one, and I didn't think that what I felt was strong enough to ever put a child in danger. So I quietly went on with my life occasionally wondering about this and trying to find some honest way to quell my own fears that I could be such a one.

My best line of defense was when I determined that there was a clear difference in how I felt when seeing a child vs a teenager vs an adult. I had a hard time explaining it, but I knew for certain that if given a choice free of any guilt or consequence, I would choose an attractive adult over a younger boy. The attraction there is much stronger and has a hard-to-describe quality that I've been trying to pin down.

And I think I'm getting somewhere.

In LGBTQ+ circles, and especially once you encounter anything in the asexual community, you learn that there are lots of different types of attraction, and they aren't all physical. The three I'm interested in talking about today are probably the trickiest ones to separate from each other, but I've got an idea. Here it goes.

* Aesthetic attraction - the appreciation of beauty, a desire to look at something or someone and maybe inspect small details, a curiosity in how the pieces fit together to create the whole
* Physical attraction - a desire for contact and closeness
* Sexual attraction - a desire for sexual contact or behavior

The first two might be easy to distinguish: you can appreciate a beautiful person without wanting to hug and kiss them. The second two might most easily be distinguished by the difference between close friends comforting each other with a hug but not being tempted to go further.

*Also, honorable mention to romantic attraction here, since it's so closely associated with the rest of them. But I think I can safely leave it out of the conversation today because I'm not talking about dating or relationships.*

But those three attractions interact with each other so much it's hard to determine their proper mixture at any given time. When I see person X, how much of what I'm feeling is aesthetic, physical, or sexual? How can you tell? Do they feel different?

Picture this.
