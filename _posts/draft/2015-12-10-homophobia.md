I don't usually find myself on this side of the gay/straight debate, but today I write to defend (to a small degree) homophobia. I write this post because of a statement I just read along the lines of "homophobia, even though it is disguised as concern, is inherently hateful." This made me cringe, because I don't see homophobia as a black-or-white issue.

For the purpose of clarity, I will try to provide what I consider to be the most accepted definition of homophobia.


> Homophobia: *n.* The fear of individuals or groups related to homosexual, bisexual, transgender, or other non-heteronormative gender expression and behavior. Also used to describe any attempt to marginalize, change, or prevent such expression and behavior.

The problem isn't with this definition. The problem comes when people try to assign underlying motive to homophobic actions and statements. I'm not arguing that homophobia should be socially acceptable. I'm arguing that there are many varied and complex reasons someone would express homophobic behavior.

## Ignorance

I believe ignorance is by far the most common reason for homophobia; whether it's the assumption that I don't know any LGBTQ+ people, or that it's a choice, or that it can be changed, or whatever. Even with the growing awareness and acceptance of LGBTQ+ issues, it is a very new concept to many, and the environment in which someone learns about it has a strong effect on their attitude toward it. Many learn about it in a religious setting, from pastors and teachers who don't know much themselves. Many learn from parents or other elders who grew up in a culture far less understanding and accepting of the concept. It often takes direct exposure to the issue -- whether the person experiences it themselves or has a close friend or family member -- for someone to begin to learn properly, and even then they need to approach the issue with an open mind.

The world is slowly changing for the better, as far as ignorance is concerned. But if it takes direct exposure to individuals belonging to the LGBTQ+ spectrum, those individuals need to feel comfortable explaining their experience to others. If they're afraid to come out, we can't learn from them. We need to, as a culture and as individuals, open our minds to the reality and the validity of this different world, or we'll never be able to learn.

## Hate

Well, yeah. Obviously there are plenty of people who legitimately hate anyone who is different, anyone they can't understand. And honestly, unless they change their hearts and open their minds, we just have to put up with their bigotry and wait for them to die off.

## Religion

Religion is the most complex reason for homophobia. There is such a wide gamut of religious teachings, and an even wider variety of religious individuals, every one interpreting the teachings according to their own experiences.

I'm going to qualify this slightly and limit my statements to Christianity, since I have a decent understanding of the doctrine here.

Christianity should never be an excuse for parents to disown their children (there *is* no excuse). It should never be an excuse to forbid a child and their partner to attend a family gathering. Christianity commands us to love, not to judge.
