Some time last week Elder Bednar, one of the leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, held a Q&A session with church members. [One of the questions asked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4_wTGv8Ao) went like this:


> How can homosexual members of the Church live and remain steadfast in the Gospel?

Elder Bednar's answer has sparked a lot of conversation and debate by critics, because one of the first things he said was "there are no homosexual members of the church." The misunderstanding of this statement has led to a lot of anger, enough that [I got involved](https://www.facebook.com/dallin.lauritzen/posts/10153493644808063) in trying to discuss what he meant and how I think he could have worded his answer more clearly.

But late last night I also had the opportunity to have a good and long conversation with a friend on the subjects addressed in the video. I got to explain my reasons for supporting the church. It was calming and enjoyable.

And now it has inspired me to go into a little more depth. Get ready...

If I'm honest about my reasons for staying with the church, they don't make much sense. Here I am, telling people that I'm okay with avoiding homosexual relationships, even though I might never find myself involved in a heterosexual one in this life. And I put on a cheerful face and shrug when they point out how sad that sounds.

I could tell them how much I watch LGBT people on YouTube and Netflix. I could say just how much it hurts to see happy gay couples, because I want what they have. Then I could try and explain to them how such a relationship would be "purely physical" to me and that the only times I've been truly happy have been in the context of my religion. Maybe they'd start to see just how confusing it is for me, even now, to try so desperately to imagine myself in a relationship when I'm trying so desperately to be happy without one.

And at the same time I'd be trying to make sure they realized that I'm not questioning the church. Because I've never doubted. I know the church is true. And I know how I feel about other men. And most of the time I act as if I've figured it all out, because that's the face I need to show people who are more confused than I am.
