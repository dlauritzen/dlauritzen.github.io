I'm getting back into a writing mood, it's been months since I got deep on LGBT stuff, and my 3rd out-iversary is approaching. Sounds like a good time to dive back in.

A concept within the "Gay Mormon" universe that is so common it's neighbors with clich√© is how we're "minorities within a minority group," or "stuck between two worlds." We say this because we don't feel like we fully belong in either community; we're strange to Mormons because we're gay, and we're strange to LGBT folks because we're Mormon.

Now, "Christian" and "Gay" seem to be making friends, at least a little. But "Mormon" is having trouble because we can't give up or change our fundamental doctrine to accommodate the decisions of our LGBT members, and the culture has no clue how to handle us yet. The people are coming around slowly, I think, but this kind of change has to happen from within each member; it can't be dictated from the leaders. Sites like [mormonandgay.lds.org](https://mormonandgay.lds.org/) and increasingly frequent mentions from church leaders are raising awareness and helping the cause. But there's still a long way from where we are to a culture where gay couples and trans people feel comfortable walking in to a chapel without fear of scorn, mockery, or neglect.

But still, we stay. We stay in this church that will never let us marry someone of the same sex. This church that emphasizes the eternal importance of families above almost anything else but insists that we can't create that kind of family with many or even all of the people to whom we're attracted. This church that, even as it begins to support the existence (though not the behavior) of homosexual members, seems to leave transgender members without any answers at all. How can we bear to stay in such a church?

Our reasons are our own, and they are too many and too complex to do justice here. And many of us leave, for just as many reasons. I've already given [my reasons](https://dallinlauritzen.com/post/why-im-still-a-mormon) for staying, and this isn't the time for me to go deeper. But I hope I've shown how difficult the conflict is. I hope you can feel and understand why we can't give up either part of ourselves. You can't give up half your heart.

 

 

And for future reference/things to nag me about, here are a few topics I'm interested in writing about eventually:

* How seeing/interacting with openly romantic/sexual same-sex couples makes me feel
* Notes on the 2017 North Star Conference
* Update on my social/spiritual life
* "The State of the Closet" address -- update on basic history, rehash of religious motivations, etc
* Masculinity
