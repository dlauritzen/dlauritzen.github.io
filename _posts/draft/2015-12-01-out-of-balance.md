I'm a little scared to write this post, because I don't really want my parents to read it. I don't want them to feel worried about me. But I need to write it, and I figure sharing it could help someone.

I'm unbalanced, and I've been growing more and more unbalanced for a while now. My religious self and my "baby-gay" self are fighting for my attention. I'm supposed to keep them balanced, maintain good priorities and keep my emotions and temptations in check. But my religious side is losing. I don't read my scriptures, I don't pray, I succumb to temptation as a matter of habit. I distract myself by focusing on other things, like new and exciting travel plans and entertainment. But the truth is I'm just so entranced by my attractions that the religion of my youth gets set aside.

Sometimes I feel the loss. Sometimes I remember the peace and joy I've known. This is often enough to get me to pray again, read scriptures for a while, repent and resist temptation for a time. It works until I forget how bad living without religion feels. Then an innocent image, video, or attractive passerby comes along and the seed is planted in my mind. It might take some time, but eventually my will is bypassed and I fall back into darker habits.

Last night I was thinking about this again. I wondered briefly if things would be different were I straight. But I realized I would have the same problem: it would just be women that I had trouble ignoring. And as is my habit, I laughed at the conundrum. I *like* being gay. I like finding men attractive. I don't want to lose that appreciation. Realizing the truth has opened up a new world to me, and it's exciting and fun.

And that's not a problem. That's not something that needs to change.

The thing that I need to control is my lust. I need to stop turning men into mere objects in pursuit of an emotional high.
