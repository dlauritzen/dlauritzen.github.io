I've mentioned [North Star](http://northstar.org) a lot in the two years since I started this blog, but every now and then I hear people who are outside the organization, or who have left, telling other people about all the harm they believe it can cause. So all I can do is give my complete and honest experience with this group.


I found North Star when my mom told me about the Voices of Hope project they create. I signed up for the men's email group, where I was able to communicate with other LGBT men for the first time. Many of the men were anonymous, since email doesn't require exposing your identity, but I eventually stopped reading the posts because email just isn't my thing.


But when I heard about the Facebook group I got excited. The conversations were often deep and interesting, and I was able to see faces and names to go along with the words. It was this group that actually got me actively using Facebook again.


The group goes through phases, and some topics pop up every month or two. Questions about which labels people use and why, dating and marriage, church leaders. Pleas for support and comfort when friends, family, or church leaders don't understand. And every so often someone announcing their departure from the group due to such-and-such reason.


I've stepped back a little from reading every single post on the group, though, because it's emotionally taxing to hear everyone's concerns and pain. If you aren't in a good and stable state yourself, you can't really help others very well.


Some voices are more radical and liberal than others, but that's to be expected when you have such a wide range of people in the group. I'm probably in that group myself, but I don't talk very often.


North Star does not encourage reparative therapy. They do not say that everyone must get married. They do not tell people to remain closeted. They do not say our sexuality is a sin or anything to be ashamed of.


The only official thing about North Star is its support of the LDS church and doctrine.


So yes, North Star tells me to either be celibate or marry a woman, because that is what the church says.
