I know very little about the Cold War. I wasn't alive and I haven't asked about the experience from anyone who was. All I know about it I learned back in grade school or from television and movies. So forgive my ignorance. But I think it's not such a huge stretch to compare the current political divisions in our country with the feelings between the two sides of that painful era.

Depending on your own opinion and political leaning, you might associate your preferred political party with the "good guys" in the Cold War, and the other side with the "bad guys," but I'm not picking sides here. Neither party is good or bad in this post. Neither party is good or bad in the real world. Both sides (in the Cold War and today) are just trying to accomplish their goals to make the world a better place using different and potentially opposing methods.

Our differences manifest in what we want the world to be like and what we're willing to do to make it that way. Our past experiences, our beliefs, our culture, affect the way we see the world and others. Different experiences lead to different world-views. And when you bring differing opinions together there will be friction. But that friction is good, because it hinders oppression and encourages compromise.

But the problem today is that we're no longer willing to bring our opinions together, to compromise. We no longer see that friction as a good thing. Instead we see the friction as roadblocks to a better world. We see any opposition as inconceivable naïveté, stubbornness, or outright evil, instead of necessary and beneficial tools. It's as if we're at a gym, trying to grow stronger, but we keep on yelling at the equipment for resisting us or the weights for being so heavy.

A lot of people are scared, and a lot of people are hopeful. Many people think the government is falling apart, and many people think it's finally coming back together. Some are frightened they will be abused or forgotten, and some are glad they will now be respected and remembered.

These feelings are normal during any change of power, but this time the effect is stronger.
