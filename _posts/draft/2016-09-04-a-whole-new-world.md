A lot has happened since my last published post. I've started at least three drafts on various subjects since then, but I've never managed to finish and hit go. But it's Labor Day weekend and I have a ton of new things to talk about.

In the three months since my last post I have changed jobs and moved to a different state.

## The Interviews

Towards the end of June I received an email from a recruiter at Google saying they would be sending interviewers out to Salt Lake City in July and asking me to apply. I had originally applied for a job as a tester at YouTube back in 2013 when I was graduating college and looking for a full-time job. It took them a year to reply to my application, and at that time I told them I was happy with my job and wasn't looking to change. But when they contacted me again I was in a different place. I had reached a stable state on the LGBT front. I had spent a few months in Europe learning what I'm capable of and what the wider world has to offer. And my job was becoming more stressful and less satisfying, despite the heroic efforts of my managers to handle the problems coming their way. I was open to the idea of change, and the timing was especially portentous. The day I received the invitation to apply was only a few days after I finally began discussions with a realtor to buy a house in the Utah valley and effectively "settle down" in the area for a few years. To me, all these things added up to an unmistakable push from the universe that it was now time for me to leave my comfortable world once more. I said a brief prayer accepting that I would leave if an offer was extended and accepted the invitation to interview.

I had interviewed for major tech companies before. First when I was nearing graduation, Apple gave me two phone interviews before letting me go. Then two years ago Facebook contacted me for an interview before also letting me go after two calls. I've mentioned how I consider the Apple interview failure a good thing, as it would have placed me in San Francisco when the realization of my same-sex attraction became conscious, so I would not have had the same access to Gospel-centric support in the midst of important decisions. When Facebook talked to me, I felt I was ready to live without the proximity to North Star resources. Facebook wanted me to apply for a position in Seattle, so I researched the city and was very excited about the opportunities living in a big city could bring. But it was not to be. So when Google came up again, asking where I would like to work, I said Seattle might be nice.

On July 6th I had my phone interview, immediately after a holiday weekend family reunion in Texas. I had spent some time in the two weeks since the initial invitation studying the common Computer Science subjects frequently used in technical job interviews, but it had been years since I graduated and my specialization had nothing to do with complicated algorithms and data management. But the interview went well. I was able to finish the first challenge and answer some follow-up questions related to it, with a few minutes left of the allotted time. Having spoken to some interviewers since then, I now know that it isn't really a problem if the interviewee runs out of time trying to solve the problem, as long as they've shown enough about how they work and what they know. But it kind of ruins confidence when you can't complete the task they brought to you within the time limit. My other tech interviews had failed before I could meet anyone in person, so I was so happy when they called me back to invite me to the in-person interviews in Salt Lake City. I chose the morning of July 19th and went back to studying some more.

At this point they sent me the official job application and asked for my resume. On the application it asked for professional references, so I realized it was time to tell my managers at work that I was interviewing for another job. They behaved admirably, saying that they were happy at the opportunities coming my way. I knew leaving would hurt and make their jobs more difficult, but they insisted that I shouldn't turn down an opportunity for growth just because it would affect the people I leave behind.

So I took the day of the 19th off and rode the train into town. I made my way to the hotel where they would hold the interviews and met the two other interviewees that morning. In the course of the next two days, Google would interview sixteen candidates. My schedule consisted of four 45-minute interviews with 15-minute breaks in between, followed by lunch to end the day. Each of the interviews had a different flow and focus, due to the different interviewer running it. Two felt more difficult and made me worry a bit, but after each one I felt I had shown my skills and understanding. After lunch I walked up to the temple and did a session to unwind, think, and pray about what was happening.

I was told that the next part of the hiring process was to send all the feedback and information from the various interviews to a hiring committee, which would give their stamp of approval. At that point they would begin looking for teams within the company with openings that were interested in taking me on. They said I should hear back from them in about three days.

The next Tuesday my parents arrived to stay the week. They've made it a habit to try and visit each of their children at least once a year. So even though we had just had a family reunion, they still came up to see me. It helped that my mom's family was having their own kind of reunion that weekend. This was also their last summer to visit us before leaving for their mission teaching in Tonga for two years. As I write this they are in the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah.

Throughout the week as I spent time visiting family I was getting several phone calls informing me that I had made it past the hiring committee and that my recruiter could begin searching for teams in Seattle that wanted to take me. I spoke with a team manager who was interested, and said that I was interested in return. By the end of the week I was told my application would be sent in for final approval. At this point it was still an open question when I would be able to begin. At work I was trying to finish a long-running project that was taking longer than expected, and no one else was involved. So leaving it unfinished would cause an even longer delay as someone else figured out everything I had done. But software developers are horrible at estimating how long a project will take, because you can never really know what problems you're going to run into along the way. In my head I figured I would take the rest of the month of August to finish up, then have two weeks in between jobs to pack up and move (and maybe head to New York for a few days to celebrate).

The next Monday I got an email from the recruiter asking me when I could begin. Because the team needed someone to fill a vacancy, and there was another candidate that might work if I couldn't start for a while. I didn't want to lose my chance because I waited to long to start. After a quick prayer asking whether this was still the right thing, I went in to my manager and asked if I could leave in two weeks. I responded to the recruiter saying I could possibly begin work at Google on August 15th. The next day he said he'll submit the application and moved the potential start date back to the 22nd.

And I didn't hear back for almost two weeks.

Word began to spread around the office that I was leaving, but I didn't make any official or public announcement because I didn't have the job yet. I had set my last day of work to be the 12th, and the 12th was quickly approaching. I was rushing to get the project finished, or at least good enough that it wouldn't be difficult for my coworker to finish up. And I was hoping that when I left the office on Friday that I wouldn't be jobless.

The evening of Thursday, August 11th, the recruiter called me and said I was in. I would receive the official offer letter the next day, and I would begin to get a lot of emails setting up travel and accommodations and relocation and the like.

## Moving

When I walked into work the next day, I told my manager that I had indeed received the official offer. At the morning meeting, our QA tester brought some fruit smoothies and breakfast pastries. She hadn't heard about me leaving until the day before. I hadn't made any public announcement because I didn't get the offer until the last moment.
