I write here for a few reasons. I hope that my words and thoughts can help people in similar situations. I enjoy the practice of writing things down and sharing them with others for their entertainment and education. But I also want to share my soul, because through these posts I feel that I am somehow *known*. This blog isn't just a place for me to share what's happening on the surface. It's become a way for me to express parts of my inner experience that I rarely if ever show to other people.

It's been some time since my last post. Some cool things have happened, but I've either been lazy or busy enough not to feel like writing about it. But I'm in a pretty pensive mood right now and had an idea that was worth exploring. None of these thoughts are new, really, but I've never really focused on this subject here.

Masculinity (or femininity) is a pretty important concept when thinking about the LGBTQ+ experience, but I don't think it's often talked about in the open. We use phrases like "secure in my masculinity" to express our undeniable "straight"-ness in the face of "questionable" activity.
