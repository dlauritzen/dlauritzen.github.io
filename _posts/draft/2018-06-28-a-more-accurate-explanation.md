I don't know if there are other topics I want to write about, but I feel like I'm stuck and unable to write about anything until I cover this...

I [hinted](/post/a-slightly-different-picture) at this late last year, and I've talked about it in person a few times, but in my public posts I kept trying to hold back, leave room for people to interpret it in a way that'll make them feel better. It's telling that I feel more afraid to say this than I did about my first coming-out post. I have to say this forcefully and without room for confusion.

I don't believe.

I grew up in the LDS church. I learned all the doctrine and read the scriptures. I went on a mission, through the temple. I did the things I was supposed to, and I often felt the things I was supposed to. But I don't any more.

Now when I go to church or think about things, I see it completely different. I see people trying to do good things and understand a strange world and even stranger souls. But the things that give believers comfort and strength don't do the same for me now.

Belief is a strange thing. It's not logical: it's a feeling. You can't choose to believe something, you do or you don't. You can *want* to believe, and you can work to overcome known barriers to belief. But that deep down conviction that something **is**, that the world makes more sense with it than without, that even though you don't or can't ever *know* you're willing to act without proof. That is a precious thing that doesn't come just because you want it to.

That's what happened when I started honestly evaluating my own feelings about my religion. I was searching for true belief, and after picking every little thing apart, the only bit I was left with was the sense of a soul -- that what made **ME** was more than this body. And all the other stuff, about God, scriptures, priesthood... I realized that for me, I felt none of that conviction.

This change in perspective worried me. I wondered whether I had been lying to myself and everyone else for my whole life. If I could so quickly discard decades of testimony, was it ever there to begin with? My mom says that even if I don't feel it now, that doesn't mean I didn't feel it then. So for now I'm going with that.

Which has led to a much more interesting conflict, because I can't dismiss everything. I don't believe it's *not* true. But until I can honestly tell myself that I believe in God, none of the other things can get resolved.

And so I now see myself in this odd limbo, between belief and doubt. I don't have any grudges against the Church or its leaders. In fact I'm still going to church and will continue attending. But I don't claim to believe, and I'm not actively trying to change my mind.

I sometimes explain things as if there was some omnipotent force directing my life. In certain situations I might even pray for comfort or guidance. It's not too rare for me to feel what I've been told is the Spirit, and sometimes the situation can't easily be explained away. But that's not enough.

I know the doctrine, I know every argument you might think to make to persuade me. But if my parents can't do anything, there's no other human on earth that can, so save yourself the effort.

So there are a few questions you might have.

* **What are you, then? Atheist? Agnostic?** -- You can call me whatever. I'm currently enjoying the idea of "proto-atheist." And like the term actually means, by saying "atheist" I mean "without God", not anti-God. I go about my everyday life as if there was no religion. But due to my belief in *something* more than myself, I can see how either the religion or the reality of God could exist. But because I don't personally believe, I'm just being honest.
* **Catch-all question about atheists and things like morals and science.** -- I still have the ethical foundations my parents, society, and experience has taught me. What I see as right and wrong is based on the effect it has on others, on their future potential and their sense of dignity and freedom. Politically I'm more aligned with liberal things, but I leaned that way before I even knew I was gay. I don't want to smoke, drink, or do drugs. I do want to find someone to love.
* **Doesn't this mean you're going to hell/outer darkness?** -- Depends on who you ask. As far as LDS theology goes, I'm much more likely to end up in the Terrestrial Kingdom for something like this. Outer Darkness is a "you gotta wanna" kind of place. For all the other Christians, probably yes.
* **You just need to pray, read the scriptures, and go to church. You'll get your testimony back.** -- One thing I've noticed about the scriptures and talks: almost all religious teaching assumes a belief in God. Without that belief, there's no power in such things. Trust me, if I get into religion again, it'll definitely be the Mormon one; it's the only one that makes any sense to me, even now when I'm being skeptical.
* **Is this just because the church doesn't like gays?** -- Maybe, but if it is, it's more subtle than I can detect. If I was mad at the church I'd run away and find some other more affirming church. This is deeper.
* **Why not just keep it quiet? This is just a faith crisis, you'll get over it.** -- I've had faith crises before. Every time I was able to stand back up on my testimony from past experiences. Not so with this. And why not just stay quiet? Like I said at the beginning, keeping this bottled up is stopping anything else I might want to say. I'm done hiding from myself to make others happy.

I'm afraid to publish this, because at least with my coming-out post I told people I was sticking with the church, so family could hold onto some hope. But this is one more step away from what everyone thinks is right. There's a lot of pain and sadness in my future in their minds. How can I be happy if I'm not looking to Christ? I know my mom doesn't understand it.

There's no way to soften the blow or convince everyone that this is the right thing for me. But this is how things are, and how they have been for a while. Now you know.
