This subject needs to be addressed. I hope this can help those with friends or family caught in the trap of addiction to understand the struggle. And I hope that those who face this demon themselves can find in me a kindred soul. I write this to try and bring a voice to those who suffer.

# My Story

My addiction to (gay) pornography began early in high school. Drama between friends caused me great stress, and I found escape and release looking at shirtless and naked boys online. My bishop found out eventually and was able to help me clean up my act before graduating. My freshman year at college was free from temptation, thanks largely to my wonderful roommates including me in their activities despite my introversion. After returning early from my mission for medical reasons I returned to college in late 2010, this time in a private room without close roommates. The stress quickly returned and I relapsed. Over the next three years I went through cycles of addictive obsession in silence. My church attendance began to suffer and I kept myself from making friends. Eventually I graduated and moved into my own private apartment. My isolation continued, but I was finally aware of my growing need for close friendship.

It was around this time, in September 2013, that my mom called me up, asking for some input on the subject of protecting the home/family from pornography. During this phone call I admitted to my years of relapse and finally came to the conscious realization of my own homosexual attractions. For the first time I had to confront myself and make very important decisions. Do I stay active in the church, or do I pursue my attractions? I knew from my own experience that I found no spiritual satisfaction in the pursuit of gay porn or masturbation. I knew from my own experience that the happiest I had ever felt was in the temple with my family. I had faith in Jesus Christ and His restored church. The decision to stay was simple.

Life since then has not been so easy.

All the craziness associated with coming out to myself and the world overshadowed the problem of pornography so much that I had nearly six months of sobriety without really trying. But since I had never really resolved my addiction, it eventually resurfaced and I have continued to battle it ever since.

Things started to change two weeks ago. A friend asked me if he could stay with me for a while after getting kicked out of his house for hiding addictive behavior from his wife. While he was with me he was so intent on working through things and getting back home. His intensity inspired me to go back to addiction recovery support group meetings. Now we go together once or twice a week. For the first time since high school I have a friend bridging the gap into my personal life. For the first time in years I am reaching out for help and being accountable for my behavior.

# The Ritual of Addiction

Through repeated exposure to the stimulus of a given addiction, our brains are literally changed, building an ever-strengthening connection between pleasure and our addiction. This pathway bypasses higher brain function like thought and willpower. When we are triggered by any number of things our brains begin a ritual. We fantasize about the perceived reward. We begin to obsess over how we might obtain this reward. Logical thought turns off and the primal beast takes over. We act out. Our brain is rewarded. The pathway is reinforced, making it easier for the next time.

The only way to overcome addiction is to change the ritual.

# The Ritual of Recovery

Attending an addiction recovery support group is strange. Nothing's ever really explained for the new people -- everyone else seems to know what they're doing. People say random things on queue. You just have to watch what's happening and figure out what to do. Eventually you go enough that you learn the ritual and can participate in sync.

Sounds a lot like church.

Rituals teach patterns. They form habits. Church teaches prayer and devotion. Schools teach discipline and scholarship. Family teaches love and support. Ritualized habits are powerful and deep. It takes deep habit to go against selfish or reckless instincts.

# Support and Accountability

I attend two different support groups: the Addiction Recovery Program (ARP) of the LDS church, and Sexaholics Anonymous (SA). Both groups are 12-step systems with many similar rituals, but each provides a different perspective and approach. Attending both helps me by effectively doubling my support and accountability.

I think the most powerful and important part of these programs is how they force each member to externalize their addictions. Addiction encourages isolation and must be countered with outside help.
