On June 26, 2015 the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in favor of same-sex marriage, making it legal in every state. It has been a long battle for the LGBT world to gain legal acceptance and equality, and this is a major milestone in that fight. The world has once again erupted into cheers and tears with people praising the courts and proclaiming the end of the world. Companies and individuals are showing their support with rainbow-ified profile pictures and hashtags like #LoveWins. There is a lot to talk about, and I want to do the subject justice.

I wrote up a [blog post](/post/gay-marriage) last October when the Supreme Court declined to hear several cases on gay marriage, which in turn made it legal in several states. My reaction to the news yesterday was not as strong because it wasn't a surprise.

I'll start off by summarizing my position again. I support the legalization of same-sex marriage. I'm not going to argue against those who disagree, and I'm not going to demean anyone for their beliefs. Everyone deserves to have and express their own opinions.

## From the Horse's Mouth

When I heard the news via Facebook, I looked for people who were sharing articles from somewhat level-headed sources, but everything seemed too polarized for me. I ended up going directly to the source and found the actual court ruling, which you can download [here](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf). I started reading through the document and highlighting parts I thought were interesting or summed up the surrounding legalese.

The document begins by talking about other major changes in the cultural practice of marriage, such as the end of arranged marriages or dowries. It cited the precedent ruling that allowed mixed-race marriages. Four "principles and traditions" are then given to justify the court's decision that "the reasons marriage is fundamental under the Constitution apply with equal force to same-sex couples."

First, "the right to personal choice regarding marriage is inherent in the concept of individual autonomy." This is a reference to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution and the reason why interracial marriage was legalized in *Loving v. Virginia*. The court reasons that "decisions about marriage are among the most intimate that an individual can make... for all persons, whatever their sexual orientation."

Second, "the right to marry is fundamental because it supports a two-person union unlike any other in its importance to the committed individuals."

Third, same-sex marriage "safeguards children and families and thus draws meaning from related rights of childrearing, procreation, and education. Without the recognition, stability, and predictability marriage offers, children suffer the stigma of knowing their families are somehow lesser." This is the reason that I support same-sex marriage under the law. Not to protect children or provide stability, but to remove the stigma. I heard an argument some time ago that we could provide exactly the same legal protection to same-sex couples as marriage offered to heterosexual ones, just "don't call it marriage," since marriage is such a religious concept to many. To me, offering the same legal obligations and protections, but calling it something else, is stigmatizing.

Fourth, "marriage is a keystone of the Nation's social order." States have placed marriage "at the center of many facets of the legal and social order.... It is demeaning to lock same-sex couples out of a central institution of the Nation's society, for they too may aspire to the transcendent purposes of marriage."

## What I Think

Occasionally the ruling makes some odd statements, and it's clear from several sentences that this decision is a result of the cultural shift in recent years. "The limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples may long have seemed natural and just, but its inconsistency with the central meaning of the fundamental right to marry is now manifest." "...new insights and societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality within fundamental institutions that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged..."

## What About Church?

As expected, the LDS Church released a statement on the court ruling.


> The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints acknowledges that following today's ruling by the Supreme Court, same-sex marriages are now legal in the United States. The Court's decision does not alter the Lord's doctrine that marriage is a union between a man and a woman ordained by God. While showing respect for those who think differently, the Church will continue to teach and promote marriage between a man and a woman as a central part of our doctrine and practice.

One of the important parts of the ruling says "the First Amendment ensures that religions, those who adhere to religious doctrines, and others have protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths." One of the fears surrounding gay marriage is the fear that religions will be forced to comply, against their own doctrine. If such requirements start to be realized, regardless of the religion being harassed, I promise to be as vehement in their defense as anyone in the world. The right of religions to teach and act according to their doctrine and conscience is more sacred than any law a secular government can impose, and I will fight with all my strength to protect that right.

## But, You're Gay!

The basis of the court's ruling is that the 14th Amendment guarantees every person protection in their choices pertaining to "individual dignity and autonomy, including intimate choices defining personal identity and beliefs." I have just as much a right to marry a man as to marry a woman. It is my choice to make. My sexuality is one facet of my identity, but so is my religious convictions. I have promised to keep commandments pertaining to chastity. To marry another man would break those promises. And while I have the freedom to do so, I have no such plans.
