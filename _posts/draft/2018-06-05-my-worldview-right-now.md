I usually try to make reasonably long posts dedicated to a single topic, but today I want to give a quick overview of how I see the world in general by explaining my current positions on everything from morals and religion to science and politics. If I missed any major topics you'd like me to add, let me know and I'll create adendums.

Oh, and obvious disclaimer: these are my opinions on controversial topics. Most of it is based on my emotions and beliefs, not facts or logical debate. I'm not trying to change anyone's mind, I'm trying to capture my current headspace and let you all know just how I feel about these things.

# Religion

Honestly, my current official position on religion is "I don't know, but I'm skeptical." I'm stuck in a bit of limbo between things I can't claim to believe anymore and things I can't explain without religion.

## God

I don't know if I believe in the existence of God. And it may surprise you but I'm not sad about that.

To me, people join and follow religions for a few reasons. One, they're looking for an explanation for the big questions (where did we come from, why are we here, and where are we going). And two, they're looking for comfort and peace in hard times (death, illness, depression). Many religious people are taught a religion from birth, and if they continue to believe it, that's their main source of explanation and comfort. And it works beautifully. The religion I know best, Christianity (specifically the Mormon kind), easily offers a concise set of answers to every possible problem and fear: trust God and everything will turn out good eventually. But if they lose that faith, the religion is no longer capable of providing any comfort and they have to find some other way. People who have that belief can't imagine happiness without it, but without that belief myself, the promise of eternity and heaven or whatever you want to call it sounds like nothing but wild hopes.

And yet I admit that I feel like there's more to me than science can explain. I don't think Joseph Smith was lying or delusional. And I've certainly felt wonderful things in religious settings like temples. I can't discount these things, but they aren't enough to get through the barriers. And belief isn't something you can choose. You can want it, but you can't force it.

So knowing that there's no other human on the planet that can convince me there is a God, I hereby state that I am content in my proto-atheism. I will likely continue to attend church because of friends and social responsibility. And I will forever consider the questions of eternity until such time that I receive more information in either direction.

## Morality

There's a common logical fallacy by religious individuals that atheists have no morals because they don't derive them from God. But deriving morals from our own logic and experiences doesn't suddenly lead to anarchy and mass murder.

I believe that respecting the dignity and freedom of all individuals is crucial to a moral society. People must be free to pursue their own education, relationships, and happiness, so long as those pursuits to not endanger the dignity or freedom of others. By dignity I mean the sense of self-worth and identity through which people judge themselves. Abuses such as torture, rape, and harassment demean the dignity of the victim. Incarceration for criminal behavior does not if conducted with proper respect.

# Sexuality and Gender

I believe in many independent spectrums of attraction, sexuality, and gender.

A few definitions are in order:

* "Sex" refers to the biological makeup of an individual, such as genitalia and DNA. While most humans are clearly delineated into either male (XY) or female (XX) at birth, intersex individuals and other genetic or biological abnormalities do occur.
* "Gender" refers to an individual's perception of their identity (both privately and socially). It informs behavior such as dress and grooming, career choice, and romantic and sexual orientation. It is most often aligned with the sex assigned at birth (cis-gender), but may differ (trans-gender). This disconnect between gender identity and sex often causes great mental and physical stress, referred to as gender dysphoria. "Non-binary" and "genderqueer" refer to individuals who do not identify with the common binary concept of male/female. This is a highly nuanced, complicated, and young area of discussion and research, and much is yet unknown.
* "Sexual Orientation" refers to the physical, romantic, sexual, or other attractions of an individual. While there are many different areas of attraction (emotional, intellectual, sexual, etc), sexual orientation most commonly ignores non-physical attraction. "Homosexual" refers to an individual who is sexually attracted to others of the same gender. "Heterosexual" refers to individuals who are sexually attracted to those of another gender. "Asexual" refers to those who do not experience sexual attraction, but may be romantically or physically attracted to others.

I don't understand gender identity, because I'm cisgender and always have been. I know it's a very real experience, though, and I consider the use of preferred pronouns and names a matter of respect and dignity. As for the religious argument that gender is spiritual and eternal, I see no reason why in this fallen world a spirit of one gender can't end up in a body of another sex.  
I believe sexual orientation is innate and unchosen. Repression of these feelings is unhealthy. I believe a healthy sexual relationship can be enjoyed between people regardless of sex or gender.

I think most of the anxiety and stress related to sexual orientation is due to social or religious discrimination. If a child grew up in a healthy environment with a supportive social structure and positive role-models, there would be absolutely no difference in rates of disease, suicide, or mental health issues between straight and gay people.

In case of an afterlife, I believe homosexual attractions will not be suddenly removed, as that would violate agency.
