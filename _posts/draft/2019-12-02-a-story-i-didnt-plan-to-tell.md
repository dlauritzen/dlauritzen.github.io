i'm bad at timelines, so I'm not sure exactly how old I was when some new neighbors moved in next door. I'm guessing I was in the 14-16 range. The family had three sons and a dog. The boys were all younger than me; the youngest was maybe six, and the oldest probably ten. The dog was big. I don't remember any of their names. They usually called me "Dude."

The boys took to me quickly and I was caught off guard by their interest. If I'm correct about my age at the time, I was privately dealing with a potent mix of loneliness and misunderstood sexuality. I wasn't attracted to these kids in the same way I was drawn to boys my age, but they granted me a surprising level of power that I did not wield responsibly.

Long before these boys moved in I had already noticed how exciting it was to see a boy's skin that was usually kept covered. On scouting and church events I would try to sneak a peek. While traveling to and from these events in the car I'd sometimes offer to give someone a massage, even trying to convince them to let me underneath their shirt. Sometimes that worked, sometimes not. Either way was exhilarating for me though I didn't understand why at the time. Now I wonder what those boys thought about me then and after. I didn't try to go farther; it was exciting enough and romance/sex never entered my conscious thoughts.

When these neighbors came into my life and wanted me to play with them, I went along with it to be nice. I was used to being one of the older kids at family reunions that could help entertain the younger ones while the adults took care of things or talked. Though I was flattered that they were interested in my company. I got used to the dog. We stayed exclusively outside, on the driveway or in the backyard. Some days I'd come home from school and my parents would tell me they had already come by earlier to ask for me.

At some point water entered the equation, which meant swim suits and nothing else.

The youngest one had a little kiddie pool set up in the driveway. Once or twice he tried to remove his suit and swim naked, to the amusement of his brothers. I had him cover up and reminded them we were technically in public since this wasn't the backyard, but it did trigger the excitement I was becoming more familiar with.

There was a trampoline in the backyard. The boys would mix getting wet with jumping on the trampoline. I don't know if they came up with the idea or I suggested it, but their swim suits came off more than once. 

I never touched, I never coerced, I never exposed myself.
