There's a notion, out there in the big wide world, that if you don't believe in something you must hate it; that if you don't agree with something, you must support its destruction; that if you aren't completely one thing, you must be its complete opposite. We don't always say it like that, but that's what people think. And it's easier to fall into that trap than you might expect.

Here's a relevant example from current events: if you think there should be any more restrictions on gun ownership, use, and acquisition, you hate the constitution and want to leave me naked and defenseless against the mighty hordes.

Or how about this: same-sex marriage will destroy the whole concept of the family. Because Bible.

Or maybe: because I did something bad, I'm an evil person that doesn't deserve love.

We're too easily fooled into believing the best or the worst, all or nothing, heaven or hell. And we're so enamored with the edges that we forget what's in the middle, or that it even exists and isn't some eternal chasm.

We think that since a small step won't solve a big problem, it's pointless or even harmful to try.

We see something we don't understand and decide it is wholly evil.

But the universe isn't all or nothing. Our choices aren't limited to 100% good or 100% bad.

Life would be much simpler if important things could be simply good or bad, yes or no. But that's a part of growing up. We have to realize that sometimes a choice isn't between right and wrong. Often the point isn't even about right and wrong.
