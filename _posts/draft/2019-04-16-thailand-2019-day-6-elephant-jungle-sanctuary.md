We woke up at 5:30 am today so we could spend the morning with some elephants. 

When the shuttle arrived it was a typical Songthaew  (สองแถว), a covered truck with benches along the sides of the bed. No seatbelts, no air conditioning except for the wind, and a major target for buckets of Songkran water (this, kids, is called "foreshadowing"). We were the last group they picked up, so we immediately set out for a two-hour drive into the mountain jungle.

We did stop for a 15-minute break at a pit stop pretty early on. There were a lot of other trucks also going to some sort of elephant sanctuary or another. I joked that this was the most white people I had seen in days.

Back in the truck we eventually left the big roads for windy streets and switchbacks. The lanes were very narrow and most of the time just a suggestion. Finally even the street disappeared and we were on dirt roads. This was our first chance to see the real countryside and it was nice to get out of the city.

When we stopped we joined one other truck of people and our tour guide. He had us help bring some bags of bananas with us and hike a little from the road to the base camp. He gave us some tunics to wear since we were going to get dirty. A little further out and we reached the spot where the elephants would meet us.

We spent a while feeding the bananas to the three elephants. They would reach out their trunks and grab one from our hands, or we could put it directly in to their mouths. 

When we had finished all the bananas we brought and taken a bunch of pictures, we went back down to the camp and got changed to get muddy and wet. We were going to help the elephants take a bath. 

We joined the elephants in the mud and spread it all over their skin (and each other). Then into the cold water in the pool nearby to wash the mud off.

They measured the elephants and checked for scratches and other things, keeping track of their health. Then we got cleaned up and ate some food they had prepared. 

A woman had set up shop there, with a bunch of necklaces, bracelets, keychains, etc. Mostly elephant themed. I found a cool little necklace I liked and asked for the price in Thai. She was trying to answer in English but I was having trouble understanding her. Once she noticed I was speaking Thai she answered in kind and I understood (I have the numbers down pretty well). I also picked out a bracelet. 

We headed back to the trucks and started down the mountain. At one point when we were going slowly around a turn two guys with water buckets splashed us. We all took a second to process before laughing. "I thought that was over yesterday!" and the like.  The rest of the way down the mountain we were on the lookout for more water. Some of us even tried to use the water bottles in the truck to fight back, but the first attempt backfired in the wind and sprayed us in the face.

I showered again when we got back, just to be sure, then we went to the mall to get some celebration desserts (more Pink Milk for me) and laundry detergent so we could clean the clothes. We slept some, then went back to the mall for dinner at Jeffer's Stake.
