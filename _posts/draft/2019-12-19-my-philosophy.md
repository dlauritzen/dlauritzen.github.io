I thought it'd be nice to end the year with a blog post discussing a few pieces of wisdom and how I see things in a big-picture sense. To do this topic the best justice would probably require collecting ideas over a long period, but I enjoy making these posts up as I go so this'll just be a few thoughts. Maybe I'll start a collection for next year.

* We're all part of the same tribe, but it's our differences that make us beautiful.
* The wisdom of parents is invaluable, but you have to make your own decisions.
