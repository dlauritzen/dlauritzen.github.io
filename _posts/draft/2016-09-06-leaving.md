In my imagination, moving away from friends, family, and home should be more painful than this. I don't know if I'm feeling the way I'm supposed to. Maybe I'm better at detachment than I thought.

So if you don't follow my life via Facebook, let me tell you the good news. I'm now living in Seattle, Washington and have a shiny new job at Google. But this post isn't really about the new things in my life. It's about the things left behind.

I'd lived in Utah for almost six years since coming home from my mission in 2010, with a brief 4-month stint in Europe. In those six years I moved between five apartments, four church wards, and three jobs. The longest I ever spent living in one place since growing up in Thatcher was with this last job in Utah. I made good friends for the first time in years. I was comfortable and happy. Things were going so well I was close to buying a house and "settling down" for another five to ten years. And in the course of three short months and without any warning I've switched jobs and moved to a big city in a different state.

And I honestly don't know if I feel anything.

It actually worries me. It makes me think my habit of emotional detachment in the face of stress is deeper than I thought. How is it that I can walk away from such a wonderful life without hesitating or looking back?
