I just watched NBC's live production of Hairspray. If you've never seen the play or movie, it takes place in 1960's Baltimore and focuses on themes of acceptance of self and others using the backdrop of the Civil Right's movement. It's a fun and moving story, and it's been some time since I last saw it. One of the most powerful songs directly references the movement, called "I Know Where I've Been," about how our past inspires, informs, and motivates our future.

Watching the show again tonight made me wonder how the themes of diversity and beauty figure in to the world right now. There's so much division and selfishness at every corner, and obviously I think a lot about LGBT stuff. People compare the LGBT equality movement to the Civil Rights movement a lot, and while there are a lot of similarities, there are many differences. But even as I thought about that, I realized that I shouldn't write a blog post about how the world has changed or needs to improve on the subject. I should write about my own past, present, and future.

How has my worldview changed since childhood? What influences shaped me into the person I am now? And how do I feel about the future?

As a child, I was concerned about myself, but that's normal. When you're young you don't naturally think about others and how they feel, what they're going through. I had my friends and family, and the rest of the world might as well not exist. The future is a distant thing; what matters is that the floor is lava or there's a dragon flying towards us. I knew only what was shown to me by adults or other kids. The Internet was not yet ubiquitous. So I absorbed the culture and knowledge of my parents, my neighborhood, my religion. I learned that we are children of God, brothers and sisters born of heavenly parents. That we came to earth to be tested, to learn from experience, and to grow strong and tall in ourselves. I knew that many people didn't believe the way I did, and that was okay. But most of the people I interacted with were indeed very similar to me, in beliefs, appearance, and desires. Not everyone is faced with diversity in their daily lives. And since that was my life and I knew nothing else, I was content.

As we grow up, we begin to explore more and more of the world. Children notice what's familiar, what's the same between them and everyone else. But eventually we begin to pay attention to what's different. We learn that we are an individual self, that me, my siblings, my parents, my friends, everyone is a different person. And once you learn something like that, it can't be unlearned. Grouping things by similarities, but dividing by differences. It makes the world much larger, but keeps it contained and safe. We continue to grow.

I was lucky to feel normal as a child. I didn't start feeling different until maturity began to creep up on me. The world was now divided into me, my family, my friends, and everyone else; but mostly me and everyone else. I worried that people were talking about me, that when they laughed as I came close, that they were somehow laughing at me. I knew I was good at school and music, so other things like sports and acting faded away. Friends came and went. I focused on myself. As the world got scarier I drew up walls to protect me.

I moved away from home and began to take care of myself. When you don't have someone outside of yourself looking in, you don't have any reason to change. I learned how to live on my own, how to navigate through the world. But I did it all on my own. I was comfortable in my little self-made shelter, so I forgot it was there, forgot that it was not growing as I did.
