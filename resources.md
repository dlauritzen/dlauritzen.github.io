I used to host a list of LDS Church-adjacent or approved resources related to sexuality and gender here, but I took all that down since I no longer appreciate that organization’s opinions or behavior on the topic. From now on I’ll only list groups and websites that I can support with my whole heart.

## Online Communities

LGBT is still a popular term used to discuss gender and sexual minorities, but all GSRM are welcome beyond lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people who consent to participate in a safe space."
