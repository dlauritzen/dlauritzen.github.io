Hey, you've found my website! Good for you. Odds are you already know me, but then, why are you reading this?

I'm an Android software engineer located in Seattle, Washington. I graduated from [BYU][1] with a BS in Computer Science in 2013 and now work for Google, but I'm a lazy bum by night and on weekends. Take a look at my [portfolio][2] for more details. I got interested in programming after learning basic webpage design in high school and taught myself for a few years before entering college. I love how programming combines creativity and problem solving with art.

I am now an atheist, though I was raised as a Mormon and served a brief proselytizing mission among the wonderful people of Hawaii in 2009. [This blog post][3] helps explain my deconversion.

I am also gay. This blog in its current form began with my [coming-out][4] and chronicles my evolution ever since. I welcome questions about anything. Seriously, I need blog topicsâ€¦

I'm a Ravenclaw at Hogwarts and a Wampus at Ilvermorny.
